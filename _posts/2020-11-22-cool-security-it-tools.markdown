Class list (TO STUDY)

Here at Penetrum we are strong believers in the opensource community. We think knowledge should be free and everyone should have the best tools to do the job at their fingertips.

That's why we decided to come up with a list of tools to help with security implementations, auditing, penetration testing, server management, and much more. Enjoy!
