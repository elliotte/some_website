Right now globalists have a variety of self stated goals, with two of the most prominent being Innovation BIS 2025 and the UN’s Agenda 2030.

The post world war two edifice is I believe in the process of being dismantled to make way for what bankers such as Mark Carney have coined as an ‘economic new world order.’ 

Rather than tear up the system, globalists have adopted the model of gradualism. It is disintegration over outright implosion. The end result is the same, but appears to the unsuspecting eye to be less orchestrated.

Instigating chaos and bringing about subsequent order – in most cases the increased centralisation of power – is essentially the modus operandi of globalists.

And it is they who now speak of Brexit as though it is a done deal. The language has shifted notably in recent months to a financial system ‘beyond Brexit‘, and preparedness for what has been termed as the ‘post Brexit architecture‘.

Brexit is happening. And when it does it will not be by accident. [3]
