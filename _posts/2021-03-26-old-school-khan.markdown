For nearly 800 years, the Darkhad have claimed to be the official guardians of the soul of Genghis Khan. But controversy abounds.

The shaman — along with 1,000 guards — pledged to protect the soul of Genghis forever.

Maybe the Darkhad were lucky to have survived the death of Genghis, as there are gory tales associated with the Khan’s passing. To honor the Khan’s wish of secrecy — we are entering deep into the territory of legend here — 2,000 people who attended the Khan’s funeral were slaughtered by his army. The army was then killed by the Khan’s escort. The escort then killed anyone that crossed their path, in order to conceal where Genghis was buried. Finally, when they reached their destination, the remaining survivors committed suicide.
