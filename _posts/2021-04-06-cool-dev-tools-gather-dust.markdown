Interesting read.

Times have changed. Itâ€™s no longer shocking when I meet a programmer who has heard of program synthesis or even tried a verification tool. 

It is not unusual at all to read a 20 year-old paper with a tool empirically shown to make programmers 4x faster at a task, and for the underlying idea to still be locked in academia.

By day, I work at MIT trying to make program transformation and synthesis tools easier to build ("programs that write programs that write programs")
