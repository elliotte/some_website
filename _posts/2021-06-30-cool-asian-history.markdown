For a millennium and a half, the steppe was ascendant. Steppe nomads created a number of empires that extracted trading rights or tribute from their neighbors and sometimes conquered them.

In the western steppe, the Scythians and Sarmatians built empires about the same time. In the sixth and seventh centuries, a group of nomads called the TÃ¼rk established another empire in what is now Mongolia. Its center was in the Orkhon valley, and it left behind runic inscriptions that are the oldest surviving texts in any Turkic language.
