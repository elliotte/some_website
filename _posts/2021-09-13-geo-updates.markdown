Wow, that is an interesting confession. Emissions targets are more important than returns in pension and mutual funds. Where have we heard this before? Oh, I know. In communist USSR where profits no longer mattered. Feelings over facts.

I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in - and the West in general - into an unbearable hell and a choking life.”

- Osama bin Laden (October 2001), as reported by CNN

We have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade a freedom-loving people to march in lockstep with a police state.

The rights embodied in the Constitution, if not already eviscerated, are on life support.

Indeed, since the towers fell on 9/11, the U.S. government has posed a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist, extremist or foreign entity ever could.

Every crisis—manufactured or otherwise—since the nation’s early beginnings has become a make-work opportunity for the government to expand its reach and its power at taxpayer expense while limiting our freedoms at every turn: The Great Depression. The World Wars. The 9/11 terror attacks. The COVID-19 pandemic.

Clearly, this is not a government that is a friend to freedom.
