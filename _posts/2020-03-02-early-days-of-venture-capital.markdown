Interesting read, cool guy?

By his own account, Fred Adler's personal net worth during his 13-year career as an investor has risen from little more than $50,000 in 1967 to a sum that is said to transcend $100 million.

Mr. Adler operated as a sole investor until he and his partners formed Adler & Company two years ago.
