Buy gold, again!

I argued that financial crises, at least, are more like hurricanes: they are the predictable result of built-up economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes.

For starters, the United States is locked in an escalating strategic rivalry with at least four implicitly aligned revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These countries all have an interest in challenging the US-led global order.

As of early 2020, this is where we stand:

- the US and Iran have already had a military confrontation that will likely soon escalate;

- China is in the grip of a viral outbreak that could become a global pandemic;

 - cyberwarfare is ongoing;

 - major holders of US Treasuries are pursuing diversification strategies;

- the Democratic presidential primary is exposing rifts in the opposition to Trump and already casting doubt on vote-counting processes;

 - rivalries between the US and four revisionist powers are escalating;

 - and the real-world costs of climate change and other environmental trends are mounting.
