- "Inflation" is an aggregate phenomenon, but even when there's a high-level cause like growing deficits and elevated borrowing, the effects show up in different industries at different times.

- eToro accomplishes the latter by letting traders follow other traders and clone their transactions on the site. One trader, for example, has users with $130m in assets following his trades. 

- India Hardware as a service, This is getting attention because some phone buyers resell their phones without disclosing the payment plan, but the model makes sense; it's a way to charge based on usage, and a way to automatically collateralize a loan without depriving the user of access to their collateral.

If Bell’s I/O holds, we're in for a new port, which means a new proprietary connection from Apple.

The successor to Apple’s MFi program, we’d argue, should be Apple Silicon Wireless. ( Airpods use, which is combo BlueTooth and WiFi )

And every time Qualcomm sells you a chip it also makes you pay for a patent license. In fact, according to their 2019 10-K, it’s 40% of their revenue and 54% of their profits.
