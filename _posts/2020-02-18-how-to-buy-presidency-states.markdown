Ex Republican major, decided to buy democrate nomination... "But the party may let a megabillionaire openly purchase its 2020 nomination anyway"

How to become president... startup and business tactics 101.

His political tactic is very simple. He does not talk about issues, as people would not like what he has to say, but simply spends tons of money:

He’s dropping huge sums of money: on staff and resources, on TV advertisements, and on Facebook ads, where Trump has long dominated.  

And he’s attempting to overcome his stodgy public image with the help of a meme army.
