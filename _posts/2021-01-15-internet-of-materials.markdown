Self-powered Audio Triboelectric Ultra-thin Rollable Nanogenerator (SATURN) is an early example of a computational material that can sense vibration, such as sound.

Using radio backscatter, we demonstrate that SATURNâ€™s sensed data is passively transmitted to remote computers, alleviating the need for batteries or any wired power for the material itself.
