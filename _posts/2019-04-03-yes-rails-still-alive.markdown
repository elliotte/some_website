Fantastic read.

"Rails is not the fastest framework in the worldâ€¦ but I will argue that performance is the last thing you should worry about when you want to scale.

In my experience, NodeJS or projects written in other frameworks start to collapse architecturally after an alarmingly small amount of complexity is added to them.

More important than how many requests you can serve per second, is how your development team can maintain productivity over time.

With the strong opinions and emphasis on code quality, Rails applications continue to remain relatively healthy and concise when compared with their brethren.

The hard cold fact of the matter is: CPU cycles are cheap. Developer hours are not.

As our Lord and savior Uncle Bob says: the only way to [go fast] is to go well."
