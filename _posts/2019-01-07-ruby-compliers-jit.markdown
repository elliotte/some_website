Computers don’t speak Ruby or any other high-level language, they only speak machine language - article [here].

In a compiled language like C++ you use a compiler to convert all of your C++ code into machine language directly before you run your program.

When you’re using an interpreted language like Ruby, your code is compiled into some other intermediary language, which is then run by the language virtual machine (VM).
