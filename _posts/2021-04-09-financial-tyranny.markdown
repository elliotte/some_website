Inflation Watch: The U.S. Has Spent $10 TRILLION in the Last 12 Months.

This is equal to the GDPs of Japan, Germany and the U.K. combined.

The national debt (the amount the federal government has borrowed over the years and must pay back) is $28 trillion and growing. That translates to roughly $224,000 per taxpayer.

And the top two foreign countries who “own” about a third of our debt are China and Japan.

That debt is also growing exponentially: it is expected to be twice the size of the U.S. economy by 2051.
