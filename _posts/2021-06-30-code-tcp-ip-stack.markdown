The core specification, however, is seemingly compact1 - the important parts being TCP header parsing, the state machine, congestion control and retransmission timeout computation.

The most common layer 2 and layer 3 protocols, Ethernet and IP respectively, pale in comparison to TCPâ€™s complexity. In this blog series, we will implement a minimal userspace TCP/IP stack for Linux.

The purpose of these posts and the resulting software is purely educational - to learn network and system programming at a deeper level
