The DNS is a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the Internet.

"In a world where one corporate entity provides the operating system for some 90% of all handheld computers (Google with Android), share the same corporate entity is used as the browser by more than 70% of users (Google with Chrome) and where a single open resolver service is used as the preferred resolver by some 10% of users (Google with Quad 8), then if the Internet was regarded as a distinct realm of human activity on a peer level with realms defined by land and sea, then Googleâ€™s ability to assert sovereign rights over huge swathes of the information technology space, based on the ability to defend its assets, must be admitted."

Google, Apple et al.. is this the resurgence of quasi nation-states such as the Honourable East India Company?
