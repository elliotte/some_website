The idea the economy can be planned by a central force has yet to succeed anywhere. The failings and ills of such programs are rooted in the fact that central planning tends to produce enormous unintended malign effects owing to erroneous incentives and price signals.

A slew of news headlines give the impression we as a society are on the verge of becoming unhinged and totally dysfunctional. 

The Government-Financial complex, a combination of the Fed, the too big to fail, and the government has become a great threat to our freedom. 

While we may not be at, our end, or the end, it is understandable why so many of the most capable contributors of our economy are now moving towards the sidelines. Capable and smart people do not have to work hard to make ends meet and are proving this by going out and enjoying life rather than working to support those that won't.
