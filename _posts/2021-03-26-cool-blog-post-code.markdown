Cool blogger (AWS lambda engineer).

There are two conclusions here for the working systems designer. First, pay attention to hardware trends. Stay curious, and update your internal constants from time to time. Exponential growth may mean that your mental model of hardware performance is completely wrong, even if it's only a couple years out of date. Second, system designs rot. The real-world tradeoffs change, for this reasons as well as many others. The data structures and storage strategies in your favorite textbook likely haven't stood the test of time. The POSIX IO API definitely hasn't.
