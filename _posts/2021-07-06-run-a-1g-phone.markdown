Analog mobile phones were popular in the 90s and the last operators ended their service only in 2007. Is it possible to run this phone now?

Nowadays all AMPS operators are obviously out of service, but thanks to the open-source contributors and the SDR technology, it is possible to run a local AMPS network, at least on the short-range scale. It can be interesting not only for self-education but also for demo purposes.

To start our micro-network, we need several components.
Software-Defined Radio Transmitter.
Software that is controlling the transmitter.
