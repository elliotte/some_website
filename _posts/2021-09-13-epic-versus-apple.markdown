Last week, in trying to think about how the Apple/Epic battle would play out - Boy was I wrong [here](//500ish.com/shall-we-play-a-game-5be4cd1ecddd)

My read is that Apple did win — exactly what everyone always knew they would win. But in winning that battle, they actually lost something far more important. There is no way around it: the judge’s order to stop App Store anti-steering is a big one. And seemingly one Apple did see coming given the Japanese settlement a few weeks back. But this is still a major blow because it both continues and accelerates the boulder rolling down the hill of real reforms to the App Store.
