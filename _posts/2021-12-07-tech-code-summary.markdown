[New Fuzzing Tool](//portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-differential-fuzzing-tool-reveals-novel-http-request-smuggling-techniques) - New differential fuzzing tool reveals novel HTTP request smuggling techniques.   Is a grammar-based HTTP fuzzer that generates HTTP requests and applies mutations to them to trigger potential server processing quirks.

A small scheme VM, compiler, and REPL in 4k - Compact language implementations are increasingly popular for use in resource constrained environments. For embedded applications such as robotics and home automation, it is useful to support a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) so that a basic level of interactive development is possible directly on the device.
