The results are eye-opening. The question they ask is how quickly an electron can find the hole in a grid. And the teamâ€™s big breakthrough is to show that these simulations reproduce the way real electrons behave in real materials.

In other words, this is evidence that free electrons naturally implement the Grover search algorithm when moving across the surface of certain crystals.
