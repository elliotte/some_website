The recession we had was 5x the average since WWII but it occurred in 25% of the time.

Druckenmiller said adding that “more bizarrely in a year when 11 million more people were unemployed, we had the largest increase in personal income in 20yrs during an economic downturn.

In three months in 2020 we increased the deficit more than the past 5 recessions combined (1973, 1975, 1982, the early 90s', the dot com bust and the GFC). The Fed in 6 weeks bought more treasuries than in 10yrs under Bernanke/Yellen.

Corporate borrowing, which almost always goes down in a recession, which had already increased from $6trln to $10trln going into the crisis due to the Fed’s free-money policies, went up $400bln. Putting that in perspective, it went down by $500bn during the GFC.

The juxtaposition of the various policy responses is somewhat breathtaking. Since 2018, M2 in the US has grown 25% more than nominal GDP; a 25% increase in liquidity. 

In China M2 to nominal GDP is where it was 3 years ago. So China hasn't borrowed anything from their future and we've had a massive liquidity input and frankly very little investment. It's primarily been transfer payments and Fed Stimulus. We've done a horrific job with the virus. The Chinese and Asia in general they've pretty much defeat the virus.

Take home #1: Druckenmiller is short long-end Treasuries.
Take home #2: He is very long commodities.
Take home #3: He is also "very very" short the dollar.
