Why we should be careful about both technological developments and our biases against them.

Our technological prowess is galloping, whereas our wisdom and ability to peacefully cooperate with one another seems to develop at a slower pace

I’m optimistic because I think the impact of technological development has been positive on humans so far  – that’s less clear about animals given the scale of factory farming. I think for humans this is the best time ever. So there’s a historical trend that is pointing in the right direction. 

But the fear is that this past threat will pose an existential risk to our human condition. I think we have gone blindly throughout our human history, we haven’t really had a master plan for our species. We invent a thing here and there, stuff happens. But we might try some intervention points where relatively small amounts of effort can make a disproportionate impact in the expected value of the future.
