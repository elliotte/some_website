For every cycle a hardware engineer saves, a software engineer will add two instructions[3].

For a few months, those who will buy M1 machines will enjoy great responsiveness and blazing start-up time. Some once bloated applications will again behave like most tools should. But soon these metrics will start to degrade. Responsiveness and start-up time will progressively revert to what they used to be and old "non-M1" machines will become even slower than they used to.
