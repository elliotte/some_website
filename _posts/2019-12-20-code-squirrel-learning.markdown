Most of our team was either a director, teacher, or student at Dev Bootcamp or similar program. Red Squirrel’s core cultural components are:

- Lifelong Learning
- Whole Self
- Transparency
- Embracing Feedback

We want our clients to involuntarily exclaim “Wow!” at least once over an engagement [1].
