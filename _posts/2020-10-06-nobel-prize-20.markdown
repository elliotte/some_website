[Physics] - Roger Penrose used ingenious mathematical methods in his proof that black holes are a direct consequence of Albert Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity.  
AND, their pioneering work has given us the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.

[Chemistry] - Using these, researchers can change the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms with extremely high precision.
