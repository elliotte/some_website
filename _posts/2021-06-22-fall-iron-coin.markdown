The dust hasn’t even settled on the collapse of the IRON stable coin —$262 million in USDC collateral is still locked in a smart contract due to an embarrassing programming bug.

 I’ve since learned that the developer(s?) behind this are already the laughing stock of the DeFi community, having wrecked each of their 3 previous projects (now 4) — though this might be their biggest hit yet.

 The idea behind the IRON stablecoin is one of “efficiency”. Other on-chain stablecoins like DAI are over-collateralised. For every $1 of DAI, there’s ~$1.75 worth of crypto assets in the DAI system.
