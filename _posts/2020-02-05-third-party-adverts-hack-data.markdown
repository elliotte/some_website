In the beginning, I searched for infected ads by just visiting the same site over and over again in a desktop browser and scanning the session for malware using Wireshark’s advanced malware analysis.

Using my rudimentary Python skills alongside the Pyshark packet scanner, I wrote a script to continuously launch web sessions and mark suspicious events based on patterns in the source code.

About once out of every thousand sessions (I launched 3,267 in total), a pretty nasty advertisement would load from one of several ad servers. In this instance, the origin was Sizmek, through the AppNexus network.

After all, AdWare doesn’t tend to make headlines — but maybe it should. If it did, networks like AppNexus might be inspired to work harder against well-studied malware, and publishers might look for a solution to prevent hackers from using their platforms as a feeding frenzy for personal data.
