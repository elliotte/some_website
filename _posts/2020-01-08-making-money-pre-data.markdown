In the 1880s, a young German-American inventor tried to interest his family in a machine to process data more quickly than humans could manage.

Knowledge is power, as 19th Century bureaucrats understood just as well as 21st Century platform companies.

That could solve the problem, because punched cards had been used to control machines since the early 1800s.

Governments soon saw uses far beyond the census.

And as algorithms improve, and more of our lives are lived online, that bureaucratic dream of omniscience is fast becoming corporate reality.
