We may soon have city-spanning public mesh networks that can be used to send text messages and emails and lightly surf the Internet. They may even be useful for voice communication. My guess is that this may happen within the next two to five years, thanks to Amazon's decision to put 900 MHz radios in some of its devices.

Amazon says its Sidewalk network has a maximum transmission bandwidth of 80 Kb/s. That is faster than the fastest dial-up modems we had in the 1990's, so it is more than adequate for sending text messages and text-only email and surfing the Internet with a text-only browser like Lynx. Networks like Gopher and Gemini are even better targets. The text of this webpage can be downloaded using an 80 Kb/s connection in less than a fifth of a second. Sidewalk should also be fast enough for voice communication under good conditions. This means in two to five years we may be able to surf the internet or talk on our 900 MHz phones while walking down the sidewalk in nearly any city whose occupants own Amazon or other competing devices. We may also be able to do this very cheaply. Individuals who do not currently use the Internet enough to justify paying an ISP for a home Internet connection may be willing to pay a small monthly charge to use the new mesh networks.
