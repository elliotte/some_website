The Byzantine Fault was one of the biggest problems that needed to be solved for a secure, decentralized cryptocurrency without double-spending or the need for trusted 3rd parties. Satoshi’s most important innovation was a ‘triple-entry’ accounting system that solved this using the blockchain introduced by Chaum.

The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.

Whoever did this had a deep understanding of cryptography … They’ve read the academic papers, they have a keen intelligence, and they’re combining the concepts in a genuinely new way.

When prominent security researcher Dan Kaminsky first reviewed Satoshi’s code he tried to pentest it with 9 different exploits, but was amazed to find that Satoshi had already anticipated and patched out all of them.

“I came up with beautiful bugs, but every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem. … I’ve never seen anything like it.”
