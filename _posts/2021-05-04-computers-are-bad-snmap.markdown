snmp at a high level was designed...

to inspect the state of various devices and potentially change their configuration.

These are protocols which allow a remote host to read and (possibly subject to access controls) write an emulated memory address space.

The entire Internet, big-I, TCP/IP world is considered to be a subset of the DOD, for OID purposes. This .1.3.6.1.4.1 space is actually managed by IANA, and if you would like your own .1.3.6.1.4.1 number they will be happy to give you one upon application.
