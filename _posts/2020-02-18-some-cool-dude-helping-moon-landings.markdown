Very cool read.

A mantra of peace and love — fueled by a little weed — inspires M.I.T.’s latest computer genius

In a rabbit hutch in Cambridge
On the Charles by the bay
A bunch of “Hot Shot Harrigans”
for Apollo saved the day.

Things on board went haywire
Lights flashed red and green
The Rube Goldbergs down in Cambridge
Descended on the scene.

“We are lost” the captain shouted
Alan Shepard was his name
But the boys at Draper shouted
“Ain’t the way we play the game.”

They went into a huddle
The game plan showed up soon
And when the dust had settled
Antares was on the moon.
