But comes from a long line of kings, once Harold died, looped back to bloody line, which Edward had planned for even tho was dead :o

The differences are striking. In this version of the story, Godwine is much less hostile towards Edward than in the first. In 1052, the very next year, Godwine and his sons sailed back to England, where, astonishingly, they were able to recover their former positions of power and Edith regained her position as queen. Godwine himself died in 1053, but his sons continued to be powerful, Harold eventually becoming king in 1066 on Edwardâ€™s death.
