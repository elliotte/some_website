Diary of a reverse engineer [here](//doar-e.github.io/) e.g.  The current trend is to attack JavaScript engines and more specifically, optimizing JIT compilers such as V8's TurboFan, In this article we're going to discuss TurboFan and play along with the sea of nodes structure it uses.  If you want to follow along, you can check out the associated repo.

Although these kinds of shellcode presented on this page are rarely used for real exploitations, this page lists some of them for study cases and proposes an API to search specific ones.
