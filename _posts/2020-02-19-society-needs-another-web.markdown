I see a society that is crumbling. The rampant technology is simultaneously capsizing industries that were previously the bread and butter of economic growth.

Increasing wage inequality and financial vulnerability have given rise to populism, and the domino effects are spreading.  People are angry.

Technology has enabled this anger to spread, influence and manipulate at a much greater speed than ever before resulting in increasing polarization and a sweeping anxiety epidemic. 

"Progress has not been without a price. Like the factories of 200 years ago, digital advances have given rise to a pollution that is reducing the quality of our lives and the strength of our democracyâ€¦ We are now face-to-face with a system embedded in every structure of our lives and institutions, shaping our society in ways that deeply impact our basic values."
