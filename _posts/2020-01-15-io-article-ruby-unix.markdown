Input/Output, generally referred to as I/O, is a term that covers the ways that a computer interacts with the world. Screens, keyboards, files, and networks are all forms of I/O. 

Data from these devices is sent to and from programs as a stream of characters/bytes.

Unix-like systems treat all external devices as files.
