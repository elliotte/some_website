[Bitcoin hasnt failed](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20211117) - 90% new things fail, predicting that makes you feel good but is easy.  Can you predict the 10% that succeed?

That’s because I forgot one essential reason bitcoin has survived:  Because people really, really, really want it to.  If there’s one lesson I learned over and over in the last ten years, that’s it. Projects don’t survive merely because they are good ideas; many good ideas get cancelled or outcompeted. Ask anyone who works at an overfunded tech company.
