In order to protect the big lie, an entire social control paradigm has been created which involves propaganda, censorship, and psychological operations (PsyOps) all designed with the same purpose: Distract you from the truth with bread and games, celebrity gossip culture, and idiotic news so you don't ask the important questions.  It starts in the school system, where they teach you that hard work and determination can make you a billionaire too!  In fact, if you look at the majority of the Billionaire class, 99% of them 'descended' from a dynasty which was established generations ago, or got their start through membership in a secret society, or something of the sort.

Bill Gates and the CIA, NDAKEY in all registry keys.

But really this is not so much about money, it's about power.  If the big lie was exposed, the Elite's would almost instantly lose their power.  Why would you visit a Hospital and get a $20,000 bill in a broken medical system, when cheap natural cures for COVID are everywhere?  You wouldn't, and that's why the censorship has to hide such information.  It's not about Politics, or Big Pharma, it's about protecting the Monopoly.
