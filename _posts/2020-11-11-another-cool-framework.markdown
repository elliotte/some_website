The jamstack rethinks the frontend architecture by separating the concerns of static and dynamic content and pushing for the dynamic side to be consumed through APIs and services

[Micro], an open source platform for microservices development.

M3O is a platform for cloud services development. The fastest way to build APIs without managing the infrastructure. M3O makes use of Micro. What we get from Micro is a powerful framework for building, running and consuming APIs as microservices. What M3O brings to the table is Micro as a Service, a fully managed platform for building microservices. Write services in Go and gRPC on the backend, expose them dynamically via HTTP API to be consumed by the frontend. M3O looks to fill that gap in the market for frontend devs. M3O is Netlify for the backend.
