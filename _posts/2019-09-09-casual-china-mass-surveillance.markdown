See how China use a series of digital attacks on Muslims living in East China ( unlawfully and with no accountability ).

A bit crazy, article [here].

Key highlights from these most recent series of attacks against the Uyghur diaspora include:

- A wide-ranging series of digital surveillance and exploitation campaigns identified via multiple strategically compromised websites
- Mobile device users running Android OS targeted via an exploit that will deliver a 64-bit ARM executable
- Website visitors tracked and targeted via Scanbox profiling and exploitation framework
- Attackerâ€™s arsenal includes Google Applications for gaining access to e-mails and contact lists of Gmail accounts via OAuth
- Doppelganger domains emulating Google, the Turkistan Times, and the Uyghur Academy leveraged by attackers
- At least two separate Chinese APT groups responsible for ongoing campaigns against Uyghurs
