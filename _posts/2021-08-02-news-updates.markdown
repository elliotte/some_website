[Requiem For An Empire, A Prequel](//www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/escobar-requiem-empire-prequel) - Control Europe – or bust. Hence the Brave New NATO World: white man’s burden revisited – against Russia-China.

So far, Russia-China had been exhibiting infinite Daoist patience in dealing with those clowns. Not anymore.

The key players in the Heartland have clearly seen through the imperial propaganda fog; it will be a long and winding road, but the horizon will eventually unveil a Germany-Russia-China-Iran alliance rebalancing the global chessboard.

[If you don’t realize that the Delta Variant only exists to make the excuse to cancel any election that is set to go against Davos then you really aren’t paying any attention at all](//www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/luongo-we-have-entered-eye-davos-storm) - 

You know, in for a penny, in for millions dead for the greater good.

Davos doesn’t even care about the people who are its staunchest supporters, no less those that it wants to destroy — meat eaters, individualists, white people and Christians, you know, most Americans.

Just look at their home turf of Europe. Floods wiped out whole towns in Germany while the presumed incoming leader, hand-picked of course Davos style, cried crocodile tears over hundreds dead while virtue signaling about Climate Change and laughing at the plight of the plebes he’s expected to lead in a few months.

At the rate the protests in France are going, the ECB will go bankrupt just supplying the Gendarme with tear gas and water cannons.

The ride from here will only get worse and our only recourse is to look to shoring up our local communities rather than hope for any saviors at the ballot box.

The rules have changed.

Democracy has been outlawed and the courts neutralized.

In fact, the law is openly hostile to your very existence. Just ask Australians and Canadians.

We’ve always known that public health was the cheat code to tyranny. Now we’re seeing it weaponized in a way that isn’t just creepy, it’s chilling in its inhumanity.
