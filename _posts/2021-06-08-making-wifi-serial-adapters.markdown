Sick info.

Serial console is one of the most important ways of communicating with embedded Linux systems. 

While talking to some network engineers, I found that some people had Wi-Fi or BLE based wireless console adapters, which allow them to access the RS-232 serial consoles wirelessly.

There is no need for Bluetooth connectivity or smartphone apps for me personally, all I want is something that I can connect to locally and lets me interact with a serial console over a secure connection. Transport security is highly desirable because having my login credentials transmitted in plaintext is highly undesirable, even on my own LAN.
