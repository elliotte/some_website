Dude spent 4 years in solidary in jail, and is ex-MIT, class read!

I’ve learned that one quality true to all genius is the ability to innovate no matter the circumstances. 

I discovered that my thoughts and my actions were the only two things I could control. It was a pivotal moment in my life. I went from being a victim of my circumstances to being a master of my destiny. I stopped worrying about when the prison administration was going to release me and focused my energy on becoming the best version of myself. 

In the middle of every crisis, there are opportunities to make ourselves better in the long run. This is our opportunity to grow spiritually, become more resilient mentally, and physically be of help to others in need.

Meditate
Create a vision board!
Learn a craft

Let’s face it, people underestimate the genius that exists behind bars.
